      <title>Hierarchical Long-Short Term Safety Control and Its Hyperparameter Optimization</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Human-robot cooperation has broad application prospects in advanced fields such as service, industry and aerospace. How to ensure that cooperative robots can run safely and efficiently in a dynamic and random environment is an important issue in the context of human-robot cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this research, robot safety avoidance is the starting point to solve the safety problems in human-robot cooperation. The hierarchical long short robot safety algorithm based on path planning and safety control algorithm is studied, and the robot safety obstacle
avoidance in dynamic environment is realized through deep visual perception of the environment. In addition, in order to improve the security and efficiency of the algorithm, an active hyperparameter optimizer for security algorithm is proposed to realize automatic
hyperparameter adjustment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The robot safety obstacle avoidance system proposed is successfully deployed on the service robot kinova Gen2 jaco2 robot, and experimental tests are carried out. The experiemnt results show that the proposed system allows robot to dynamically avoid colision during interactions with human while completing different tasks, which are shown in the video attached.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Learning Latent Object-Centric Representations for Visual-Based Robot Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://zipping-suger.github.io/project/latent_representation/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For multi-step robotic manipulation, it is important but challenging to predict the future state of the object conditioned on the applied action, especially from the original sensory observation such as images. Successful robotic manipulation requires an accurate predictive model as well as an intricate understanding of the object-environment interactions from high-dimensional images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper proposes a latent object-centric representation (LOR) that can encode implicit visual features from raw RGB images into a compact and generalizable representation of the object states suitable for future-state prediction. Based on LOR, LOR dynamic neural network (LOR-DNN) is proposed to simultaneously encode object states and predicts the future states with the applied actions of a robot. The learned LOR-DNN can generalize effectively to new situations and can even directly transfer from simulation to the real world. LOR-DNN can be used to plan action sequences to manipulate the object to achieve the target state, allowing the robot to perform multi-step manipulation tasks such as planar pushing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Real-world experiments on pushing tasks demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve a high
success rate on pushing previously unseen objects with diverse shapes and scales, outperforming state-of-the-art model-based and end-to-end methods including baselines that use ground-truth object poses. The proposed approach is an important step toward fully autonomous and generalizable visual-based robotic manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a experiment demonstration of the proposed method. Please have a look.&lt;/p&gt;
