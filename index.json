While optimization-based methods can generate smooth and feasible trajectories, they are highly sensitive to the initial guess, often leading to slow convergence or failure in complex environments. To address this issue, this research presents Deep Manipulation Memory (DM\u0026amp;M), a neural network designed for learning-based trajectory initialization in robotic manipulation tasks.\nAt Flink Robotics, I had the opportunity to bring DM\u0026amp;M from research to real-world applications in logistics. In collaboration with Swiss Post, we tested DM\u0026amp;M on parcel singulation tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving trajectory robustness and reducing computation time. This integration showcased how learning-based trajectory initialization can enhance industrial automation, making robotic systems more efficient and adaptable.

However, traditional bin-picking approaches necessitate prerequisites of static objects and fixed collisions. It leads to limitations in deployment, inefficiency during oper- ation, and unreliability under unforeseen disruptions.\nWe aim to achieve dynamic bin-picking, breaking the static assumptions in traditional bin-picking. We present a Dynamic Bin-Picking Framework (DBPF) equipping manip- ulators with strong reactivity to handle dynamic targets and obstacles simultaneously. The horizon-based discrete trajectory optimization solves the optimal action in a close-loop manner to support real-time feasible motion. Given 6D poses from suction planning at each timestep, the optimal target pose is selected with consideration of picking consistency and neural network-based tendency-aware-manipulability scores. Heuristic task-specific designs within modules and the pipeline highly con- tribute to the picking success. Through empirical experiments, our method demonstrates superior performance in terms of success rate, efficiency, and reliability than baseline approaches, showcasing a promising solution for the next generation of robotic bin-picking.

How to ensure that cooperative robots can run safely and efficiently in a dynamic and random environment is an important issue in the context of human-robot cooperation.\nIn this research, robot safety avoidance is the starting point to solve the safety problems in human-robot cooperation. The hierarchical long short robot safety algorithm based on path planning and safety control algorithm is studied, and the robot safety obstacle avoidance in dynamic environment is realized through deep visual perception of the environment. In addition, in order to improve the security and efficiency of the algorithm, an active hyperparameter optimizer for security algorithm is proposed to realize automatic hyperparameter adjustment.\nThe robot safety obstacle avoidance system proposed is successfully deployed on the service robot kinova Gen2 jaco2 robot, and experimental tests are carried out. The experiemnt results show that the proposed system allows robot to dynamically avoid colision during interactions with human while completing different tasks, which are shown in the video attached.\n","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1640995200,"objectID":"cf0a81e203d77f6c46240b6d8553583c","permalink":"https://zipping-suger.github.io/project/safe_control/","publishdate":"2022-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/safe_control/","section":"project","summary":"Safe planning and control for human-robot interaction","tags":["Safe control"],"title":"Hierarchical Long-Short Term Safety Control and Its Hyperparameter Optimization","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"For multi-step robotic manipulation, it is important but challenging to predict the future state of the object conditioned on the applied action, especially from the original sensory observation such as images. Successful robotic manipulation requires an accurate predictive model as well as an intricate understanding of the object-environment interactions from high-dimensional images.\nThis paper proposes a latent object-centric representation (LOR) that can encode implicit visual features from raw RGB images into a compact and generalizable representation of the object states suitable for future-state prediction. Based on LOR, LOR dynamic neural network (LOR-DNN) is proposed to simultaneously encode object states and predicts the future states with the applied actions of a robot. The learned LOR-DNN can generalize effectively to new situations and can even directly transfer from simulation to the real world. LOR-DNN can be used to plan action sequences to manipulate the object to achieve the target state, allowing the robot to perform multi-step manipulation tasks such as planar pushing.\nReal-world experiments on pushing tasks demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve a high success rate on pushing previously unseen objects with diverse shapes and scales, outperforming state-of-the-art model-based and end-to-end methods including baselines that use ground-truth object poses. The proposed approach is an important step toward fully autonomous and generalizable visual-based robotic manipulation.\nHere is a experiment demonstration of the proposed method.
